66. Plus One
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.


class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int n = digits.length;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // If the current digit is less than 9, just increment it and return the array
        if (digits[i] < 9) {
            digits[i]++;
            return digits;
        }
        // If the current digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue to the next digit
        digits[i] = 0;
    }
    // If we have gone through all digits and they were all 9, we need a new array
    int[] newDigits = new int[n + 1];
    newDigits[0] = 1; // The most significant digit is 1
    return newDigits;
    }
}
